# Framework Compare

Implement a set of webpages of increasing complexity in a couple different frameworks to see how they each grow with complexity

## Frameworks to consider

- angular ivy
- ember/glimmer
- inferno
- lit-element?
- qwik
- astro
- stencil
- alpine.js

## Webpages

- Static Hello World
- 7 GUIs (Based on https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/)
  - CRUD (let's make it async)
  - Circle Drawer
    - undo/redo
    - SVG custom drawing
    - dialog control (the challenge of retaining context between successive GUI operations)
  - Cells (e.g. virtual lists? many components? fine-grain updates?)
- Simple TODO
- Tic-Tac-Toe (https://github.com/jesseskinner/svelte-tic-tac-toe)
- News site clone?
- Github repo list?

- Consider eventually adding a app that delay loads component from separate chunk.
- Consider adding an app that has nested components with local state (e.g. building a design system and using it in an app)
