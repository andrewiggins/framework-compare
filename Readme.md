# Framework Compare

Implement a set of webpages of increasing complexity in a couple different frameworks to see how they each grow with complexity

## Frameworks to consider

- lit-element?
- angular ivy
- ember/glimmer

## Webpages

- Static Hello World
- 7 GUIs (Based on https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/)
- Simple TODO
- Tic-Tac-Toe (https://github.com/jesseskinner/svelte-tic-tac-toe)
- News site clone?
- Github repo list?

- Consider eventually adding a app that delay loads component from separate chunk.
