* Fill in Intro
	* Using rollup to keep bundler overhead to a minimum
	* In actuality, apps may have separate vendor and app bundles for caching reasons. This project is mainly intended to demonstrate cumulative size differences between frameworks. Actual sizes may vary based on bundler used and how app is bundled.
* Write up conclusion
* Add CONTRIBUTING guide

* Consider breaking up Flight Booker into multiple components to demonstrate how that works
* Consider having different es5 and modern JS files
	* Show two tables in metadata panel, one per output type (es5, esm)
	* Add (?) button next to ES6 module switch which links to page explaining ES6 module output
* Consider renaming "bundles" to "chunks"?

* Consider adding app descriptions to app page
* Investigate why rollup doesn't remove SvelteElement (I think adding Babel messed it up)
