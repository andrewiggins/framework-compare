* Fill in Intro
	* Using rollup to keep bundler overhead to a minimum
	* In actuality, apps may have separate vendor and app bundles for caching reasons. This project is mainly intended to demonstrate cumulative size differences between frameworks. Actual sizes may vary based on bundler used and how app is bundled.
* Write up conclusion
* Add CONTRIBUTING guide

* Add tests verifying each implementation of an app returns the expected markup
	* For Vue, implement getFrameworkFragment(frameworkName) that returns either toHTMLString.Fragment or div depending on if frameworkName supports Fragments
* Consider changing flight booker to do input validation to demonstrate how that flow works...
	* Would also make it easier to test since using date input in puppeteer is hard

* Consider having one page per app with a framework selector? with standalone page option?
* Add Compare page
	* plus button to add multiple frameworks of one app to view source and Compare
* Consider showing source files inline under app
	* Perhaps add toggle for source and js output? Particularly useful for compiler frameworks (Vue, Svelte)
	* Add link to framework repl if exists
* Add brotli/gzip radio option to summary page (power radios using /scripts/bundles/summary.js)
* Add rollup-plugin-visualizer html to output

* Consider having different es5 and modern JS files
* Consider eventually adding a app that delay loads component from separate chunk. Bundling and infra needs to handle more than 1 js file per app
* Determine what to do about styles
	* Could require apps that have styles to render pre-defined markup using classes for styles provided externally
	* Build basic style imports into every framework
* Define library for common utilities across apps (e.g. spreadsheet grammar)
	* common/ folder in src
	* lib/ workspace
* Add app and framework filtering to summary table
* Add option to show nav by App instead of by Framework
