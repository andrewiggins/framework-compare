* Fill in Intro
	* Using rollup to keep bundler overhead to a minimum
	* In actuality, apps may have separate vendor and app bundles for caching reasons. This project is mainly intended to demonstrate cumulative size differences between frameworks. Actual sizes may vary based on bundler used and how app is bundled.
* Write up conclusion
* Add CONTRIBUTING guide

* Perhaps add toggle for source and js output? Particularly useful for compiler frameworks (Vue, Svelte)
* Add app and framework filtering to summary table
* Add option to show nav by App instead of by Framework

* Consider having different es5 and modern JS files
* Consider eventually adding a app that delay loads component from separate chunk.
	Bundling and infra needs to handle more than 1 js file per app
* Determine what to do about styles
	* Could require apps that have styles to render pre-defined markup using classes for styles provided externally
	* Build basic style imports into every framework
* Add rollup-plugin-visualizer html to output
