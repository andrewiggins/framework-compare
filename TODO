* Consider having one page per app with a framework selector? with standalone page option?
* Add Compare page
	* plus button to add multiple frameworks of one app to view source and Compare
* Consider showing source files inline under app
	* Perhaps add toggle for source and js output? Particularly useful for compiler frameworks (Vue, Svelte)
	* Add link to framework repl if exists
* Add brotli/gzip radio option to summary page (power radios using /scripts/bundles/summary.js)
* Add tests verifying each implementation of an app returns the expected markup
* Add rollup-plugin-visualizer html to output

* Determine what to do about styles
	* Could require apps that have styles to render pre-defined markup using classes for styles provided externally
	* Build basic style imports into every framework
* Define library for common utilities across apps (e.g. spreadsheet grammar)
	* common/ folder in src
	* lib/ workspace
* Add app and framework filtering to summary table
* Add option to show nav by App instead of by Framework
