* Fill in Intro
	* Using rollup to keep bundler overhead to a minimum
	* In actuality, apps may have separate vendor and app bundles for caching reasons. This project is mainly intended to demonstrate cumulative size differences between frameworks. Actual sizes may vary based on bundler used and how app is bundled.
* Write up conclusion
* Add CONTRIBUTING guide

* Add rollup-plugin-visualizer html to output
* Consider having different es5 and modern JS files

* Investigate why rollup doesn't remove SvelteElement (I think adding Babel messed it up)
